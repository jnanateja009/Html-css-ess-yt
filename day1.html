        <h1>Impacts of Covid-19 on Indian Economy</h1>
        <p>
            As per the official data released by the ministry of statistics and program implementation, the Indian economy contracted by 7.3% in the April-June quarter of this fiscal year. This is the worst decline ever observed since the ministry had started compiling GDP stats quarterly in 1996. In 2020, an estimated 10 million migrant 
            workers returned to their native places after the imposition of the lockdown. But what was surprising was the fact that neither the state government nor the central government had any data regarding the migrant workers who lost their jobs and their lives during the lockdown.

            Coupled with the humanitarian crisis and silent treatment of the government, 
            the covid-19 has exposed and worsened existing inequalities in the Indian economy. 
            The contraction of the economy would continue in the next 4 quarters and a recession is inevitable. 
            Everyone agrees that the Indian economy is heading for its full-year contraction. The surveys conducted by the Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy 
            shows a steep rise in unemployment rates, in the range of 7.9% to 12% during the April-June quarter of 2021. 
            The economy is having a knock-on effect with MSMEs shutting their businesses. Millions of jobs have been lost permanently and have dampened consumption. 
            The government should be ready to spend billions of dollars to fight the health crisis and fast-track the economic recovery from the covid-19 instigated recession. The most effective 
            way out of this emergency is that the government should inject billions of dollars into the economy.

            The GDP growth had crashed 23.9% in response to the centre’s no notice lockdown. 
            India’s GDP shrank 7.3% in 2020-21. This was the worst performance of the Indian economy in any year since independence. As of now, India’s GDP growth rate is likely to be below 10 per cent.

            The Controller General of Accounts Data for the centre’s fiscal collection indicates a gross-tax revenue (GTR) of rupees 20 lakh crore and the net tax revenue of rupees 14 lakh crore for 2020-21. The tax revenue growth will be 12 per cent, which would mean the projected gross and the net tax revenues for 2020-21 would be rupees 22.7 lakh crore and 15.8 lakh crore respectively.

This suggests some additional net tax revenues to the centre amounting to rupees 0.35 lakh crores as compared to the budget magnitudes. The main expected shortfall may still be in the non-tax revenues and the non-debt capital receipts. If we look down in the past, the growth rate for the non-tax revenues and non-debt capital receipts have been volatile, but if we add them together, they average to a little lower than 15% during the five years preceding 2020-21.
